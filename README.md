# Play with Swift

> For the last few years, Swift language continues to build an active and devoted community. Let me show you what it is that Swift offers that catches people hearts regardless of the programming experience. To do it we will build a simple game in an interactive environment Apple provides on MacOS and iPad. Feel free to bring your device, make sure to have Xcode installed on the mac and Playground on the mobile.

This live coding session was prepared for Ladies of Code and took place on the 26th of March 2019.

The audience can be anyone with basic knowledge of any programming language, to have an understanding of primary concepts like arrays, strings, classes. It can also be targeted for experienced developers to showcase some of Swift's characteristics that may differentiate it from other programming languages.
